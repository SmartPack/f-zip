F-zip: Universal recovery flashable zip generator for Linux & android
	(c) sunilpaulmathew@xda-developers.com

What is F-zip about?
"F-zip is a universal shell script designed to make recovery flashable zip files with a few simple steps“

For those it is helpful?
Anyone (devs/newbies) who has something (boot.img/appxxx.apk/libxxx.so) to flash and do not want to do all the work to make a recovery zip manually

Where it works?
It will works on any Linux and Linux based operating systems including android. The Linux system might be native or with in a virtual box or even the bash inside Windows 10.

How-to-use?
1. clone or download this repo into your Linux PC or Android device.
2. copy the app folder in to "/system/priv-app" or/and "system/app". You may also copy the “.apk” files directly to “/system/app” or/and “/system/priv-app” (without folder) if your app/ROM supports to do so. 
3. copy library (typically “.so”) files if any into /system/lib (you may create separate folder(s) if it is required)
4. copy "boot.img" into the root folder (this feature is presently available for Samsung Galaxy S5 (klte) and devices that follows a similar partition structure and naming). Proper editing of “META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script“ (line#11) will be required for other devices with a different boot partition name. Don’t worry, you can easily find such details from any other working ROM/Kernel zip.
5. modify fzip.sh accordingly (please see below instructions)
6. open terminal and cd to the root folder of f-zip 
7. run ". fzip.sh" (in Linux) or “sh fzip.sh” (in android).
8. The recovery flashable zip file will be generated in the root folder

How-to-modify shell script?
Open “fzip.sh” and carefully edit the following parameters. 
# Do not touch anything else other than listed here unless you know what you are doing.
# If you are using an Android devcie, you should use a suitable script editor for making necessory modifications on “fzip.sh” (only tested using DroidEdit).
# If you are windows, you should use “gedit” or “Notepad++” to edit the “fzip.sh”. Using an non-supported program like ‘notepad’ or “wordpad” likely results the damage of this script.
